We have provided the code of our model and the results performed on SPDPR dataset as:
1. train_v4.py:  the training process of our model
2. model_v4.py: the framework of our DiscProReco
5. results of SPDPR.txt: the results of DiscProReco on SPDPR dataset.
The code should be run based on Tensorflow.
